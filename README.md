Easily batch render blender files without having to mess with command line. Drag and drop files in, or select them with the program's file explorer.

TODO list:

- [x] Optional render output path override
- [ ] get samples for progress from current image
- [x] allow default render of current frame for single image
- [ ] output log to file
- [ ] remember queue
- [ ] Let the user know when using main thread that the program will be unresponsive
- [ ] Make it so on adding a file to the queue, it gets the frame start/end info then
